# GeoGenie

HMMs used in this program come from a variety of sources, including TIGRFAMS and Pfam. 25 of the HMMs used here have been created by Karthik Anantharaman (https://github.com/kanantharaman/metabolic-hmms). The rest are custom-made by me.

## Quickstart with conda
git clone https://github.com/Arkadiy-Garber/GeoGenie.git

./setup.sh

./GeoGenie.py -h

## Quickstart without conda
(2 additional arguments required here: location of the HMM and rscripts directories)

git clone https://github.com/Arkadiy-Garber/GeoGenie.git

./setup_noconda.sh

./GeoGenie.py -h
